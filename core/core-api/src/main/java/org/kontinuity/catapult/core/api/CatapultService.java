     * The {@link CatapultService}, as the name suggests, is a launcher.  Its responsibility
     * is to take the following inputs:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>A GitHub project</li>
     *   <li>A GitHub user (OAuth token)</li>
     *   <li>An OpenShift instance's API URL</li>
     *   <li>An OpenShift user</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * And perform the following actions:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Fork the GitHub project into the GitHub user's namespace</li>
     *     <li>Create an OpenShift project</li>
     *     <li>Apply the pipeline template to the OpenShift project</li>
     *     <li>Associate the OpenShift project with the newly-forked GitHub repo</li>
     *     <li>Create a GitHub webhook on the newly-forked GitHub project to
     *        register push events to the OpenShift project</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * This will result in a fully-pipelined OpenShift project from a source GitHub repo.
     * The pipeline definition itself is expected to reside in a Groovy-based
     * Jenkins Pipeline (https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/README.md#introduction)
     * script called a Jenkinsfile.
     *
     * This project launching process done by the {@link CatapultService} is called a {@link CatapultService#fling(Projectile)}.
     * All inputs are encapsulated inside a {@link Projectile}.  The returned result is,
     * quite unsurprisingly, a {@link Boom}, which contains all information relevant to the caller.
     *
     * @param projectile
     * @return The result of the operation encapsulated in a {@link Boom}
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the {@link Projectile} is not specified
